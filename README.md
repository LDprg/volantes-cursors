# Volantes Cursors

## Original Repo: https://github.com/varlesh/volantes-cursors

### Why the fork?

The original repo did only support old xcursor themes, which fail to scale cleanly (for example in KDEs 'Shake cursor' feature).
Therefore this repo drastically improved the quality by using `kcursorgen` to generate svg themes.
Furthermore hyprland compatibility was added by using `hyprcursor-util`.
There are only changes to the build system, icons are still the same.

All credits belong to @varlesh, if you someday read this: I would be happy to merge this into your original repo!

### Install build version

Not available for now. Check out the original repo (no svg/hyprland fixes though).
Manual Install is currently required!

### Manual Install

1. Install dependencies:
   - git
   - tar
   - kcursorgen
   - xcursorgen
   - hyprcursor-util (only for hyprcusors)
